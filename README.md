GoodnightPC is currently a simple Windows shutdown app with one input field and four buttons. In the Minutes field, you can set how long until the PC turns off. There are three quick-action buttons:

30 minutes

1 hour

Shutdown now

There’s also a Cancel button to stop the shutdown process.

Planned features include a more polished interface, the ability to customize and add your own presets, and more.

Another planned section will notify you when it’s time to sleep, starting a 15-minute timer before shutdown. This timer can be postponed by 10 minutes, but no more than twice.

The app will continue to evolve and gain new features over time.
